      	</div>
      	<div class="modal-body">
      	<h5> What is depression?</h5>
        <p>Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the world. 
            					Approximately 350 million people suffer from depression worldwide and millions more are 
                                affected by their loved ones' struggles. Depression takes several forms, including major 
                                depression, persistent depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. </p>
								<br>
								<h5>What are the symptoms?</h5>
								<p>The symptoms of depression are varied and can affect all aspects of a person's life. Some 
								examples include feelings of deep sadness, moodiness, hopelessness and loss of interest in 
								activities. Other symptoms are exhaustion, changes in appetite, and abnormal thoughts like 
								self-harm or trouble concentrating. </p>
								<br>
								<h5>What causes depression?</h5>
								<p>The symptoms of depression are caused by changes in the brain's chemistry. These can be brought
								 on by genetics, hormone fluctuation, some medical conditions, excessive stress, grief or 
								 difficult living circumstances.</p>
								 <br>
								 <h5>Types of Depression</h5>
								 <ul>
								 	<li>Persistent Depressive Disorder</li>
								 	<p>A persistent and depressive mood that lasts at least two years. Some periods of less severe 
								 	depressive mood accompanied by intense bouts of depression for 2 or more years is considered
								 	 persistent depression. </p>
								 	<li>Perinatal Depression</li>
								 	<p>Extreme feelings of sadness, exhaustion, and anxiety following a birth or pregnancy 
								 	that hinders a mother’s ability to care for her child and accomplish daily 
								 	activities.</p>
								 	<li>Psychotic Depression</li>
								 	<p>Psychotic depression applies to individuals who experience both severe depression and 
								 	strong beliefs in false pretenses such as delusions and hallucinations. These 
								 	hallucinations mainly center around depressive thoughts/emotions such as guilt,
								 	 poverty, or illness.</p>
								 	<li>Seasonal Affective Disorder</li>
								 	<p>Usually, Seasonal Affective Depression manifests during the winter season and lifts 
								 	around spring and summer. This form of depression revolves around feelings of exhaustion 
								 	(increased amount of sleep), social withdrawal, and weight gain. This depression will 
								 	usually appear consistently every year around winter. </p>
								 	<li>Bipolar Disorder</li>

        <h4 class="modal-title">Learn About: Anxiety</h4>
      	</div>
      	<div class="modal-body">
      	<p>Anxiety is a common and inescapable part of life. However, for most it is temporary. This is not the case for 
      	those with anxiety disorders. People who suffer from an anxiety disorder can feel anxiety nearly constantly, 
      	and have physical symptoms which interfere with their daily life. </p>
        <p>This may sound extreme. However, it is not rare. In the United States, the most common type of mental disorder
         is an anxiety disorder. 18% of American adults experience some type of anxiety disorder. </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Types of Anxiety</h5>
		<p>Like depression, there are many types of anxiety disorders. Some examples are General Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic 
		Disorder, or Social Anxiety. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are 
		also considered anxiety disorders.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>General Anxiety Disorder</li>
			<p>Those who suffer from GAD experience persistent tension and worry over everyday situations or over nothing 
			in particular. For them, the typical anxiety of life is multiplied and constant. </p>
			<li>Panic Disorder</li>
			<p>Those with Panic Disorder experience panic attacks. Panic attacks, also called anxiety attacks, are intense
			 periods in which a person may experience feelings of fear and doom, chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath,
			  and sweating. </p>
			<li>Social Anxiety</li>
			<p>Social anxiety causes overwhelming worry about typical social situations. Those with social anxiety often fear 
			being judged or acting ‘wrong’. The fear can be so bad that they avoid social situations all together.</p>
			<li>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</li>
			<p>OCD is a chronic condition in which a person has recurring thoughts (called obsessions) and behaviors 
			(called compulsions) that they feel they must carry out over and over. The symptoms of OCD can interfere with 
			work, school, and relationships. Those with OCD cannot control the thoughts or behaviors that OCD causes, and 
			must carry them out to relieve the anxiety the thoughts cause.</p>
			<li>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</li>
			<p>PTSD can develop in a person after they have experienced a traumatic event. It causes types of symptoms like 
			re-experiencing, avoidance, reactivity, and cognition. People with PTSD may experience flashbacks and nightmares,
			 stay away from places and things that remind them of the event, be ‘on-edge’ or easily angered, and experience
			  cognitive changes like loss of memory or guilt. PTSD is common amongst veterans or young children who have 
			  experienced trauma.</p>

        <h4 class="modal-title">Learn About: Bipolar Disorder</h4>
      	</div>
      	<div class="modal-body">
      	<h5> What is bipolar disorder?</h5>
        <p>Bipolar disorder is grouped as a subset of depression, characterized by extreme mood swings between periods of 
        exhaustion and depression and those of high-energy euphoria (mania). The mood shifts can occur over months or during
         the course of a week. </p>
         <br>
         <h5>What do the shifts involve?</h5>
		<p>During the mania phase, a person can feel euphoria and high energy. However, this often goes too far and leads to 
		irritability and dangerous, reckless behavior. A person with bipolar disorder can also experience hypomania, a mild 
		type of mania that doesn’t involve psychosis.</p>
		<p>After mania comes a depressed phase, in which a person can have depressive symptoms so bad that they cannot leave bed. </p>
		<br>
		<h5> Treatment and Types</h5>
		<p>There are several types of bipolar disorders: bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymic disorder. Each one can
		 be treated but treatment must be ongoing for life. Bipolar disorder is a chronic illness and will only worsen
		  with time if untreated.</p>

      	</div>
      	<div class="modal-body">
      	<h5>What is stress?</h5>
        <p>Stress is usually described as an overwhelming feeling produced in response to stressors (Events, objects, people 
        that cause you stress) that invoke the fight or flight response; resulting in the release of adrenaline and cortisol.
          Throughout life, we continually analyze particular situations, people, and events to determine if our skill set and 
          mental capacity are capable of confronting this situation. When we are stressed, we have carefully analyzed a
           particular situation and deemed ourselves lacking the tools to tackle this challenge and thus feel some sort of 
           stress and anxiety over the situation. Logically speaking, stress is truly imperative to life; originating in our 
           primitive instincts to  fight or escape in reaction to some imminent threat, and motivating us to survive some 
           situation our brain interpret as a threat.  So while low-levels of stress can be viewed as helpful in boosting 
           brainpower and focus, too much of anything can be harmful, and stress is no exception. High levels of stress 
           lead to heart disease, a weaker immune system, and  increase aging.</p>
